				<h1 class="greet">Artificial Creatures</h1> <p>Artificial Creatures are robots who can think (well it seems they do) and act like they are real. The robots respond to emotions and show characteristics of emotions so it will look like they express themselves. Examples of a creature which shows real like emotions is: PARO: Artificial companion for the elderly and Spot: A four-legged robot designed for indoor and outdoor operation.</p>

				<h2>My idea</h2>
				<p id="introduction">
					The life of an <strong>automatic sliding door</strong> is simple, but to make it easy for the sliding doors how they have to act, here is a guide: open your mouth* horizontally when a person wants to go into/out of you. You’ll be pleased to help the person. The person wouldn’t be happy when you can’t let him/her in, so they will hit your mouth or do crazy dances how they can open you because they don’t understand you. Please don’t let that happen, you don’t want to see that.</p>
				<p>
					You need to have a <strong>motion detection sensor</strong> on the sides of your mouth to trigger you to open your mouth.  You’ll feel a high satisfaction when the sensor detects a person passing. The more people that passed you, the happier you’ll be. When the person went in/out, then you have to close him. Otherwise the people will be mad at you because all the cold or hot air comes in. Sometimes this is difficult, because when you just let one person in and want to close your mouth, suddenly another one wants to go in as well and then you have to be quick. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You are a professional when you can do this and people will be glad to have you.

				<p id="definition">*The mouth is a metaphor of the sliding doors.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<h3>Cozmo: The cute, artificial intelligence robot</h3>
				<p id="introduction">Cozmo is a cute, little, articifical intelligence <strong>robot</strong> which seems to have a real personality. When he is happy, because he won a game, then he will dance and walk backwards like Michael Jackson. When you are not paying attention to him, then he will set up a game and let you know by the phone when he’s ready and he will be upset when you ignore him. He can <strong>recognize faces</strong> and is happy to see you again. He even snores when he sleeps. The robot has <strong>21 facial expressions</strong> and has an own app and game cubes. He evolves the more you interact with him. I want him!
				<h3>Downside of Artificial Creatures</h3><p>
					Of course there is a downside of articifial creatures with intelligence, like machines are getting too smart in the future and get their own will. I have found some <strong>creepy</strong> examples of this which you can watch below.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p id="introduction">Artificial creatures are amazing for people who <strong>feel lonely</strong> or making <strong>fast animations</strong> with it in a movie. But there is a downside, like robots getting too smart.
				</p>
				<h3>Prediction future</h3><p>
					In about 200 years robots will be too smart. They are going to <strong>conquer the world</strong>.
				<h3>Did the subject meet my expectations?</h3><p>
					I had no idea what artificial creatures were. Now I have a better vision about it. It can be robots but also animations which seem to be real. </p>
